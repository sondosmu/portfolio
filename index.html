            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am Sondos Mohammed, an electrical engineering student at the University of Tripoli. Since 2022, Iâ€™ve been actively involved in website design, teaching mathematics and physics for high school students, and later giving physics lectures to university students. Additionally, I introduced the ICDL course and became the leader of the Google Developers Student Club in Gharyan, where I presented several workshops in programming. I'm passionate about learning, volunteering, and constantly developing my skills. I am also a member of the GDG (Google Developer Group).</p>
